15,KPI-AF-008 (Power Grid),Assistant alert accuracy (Power Grid),Task 4.1,Effectiveness,O2,Power Grid,"['Human machine interaction module', 'Digital environment']",fully automated evaluation,"Assistant alert accuracy is based on the number of times the AI assistant agent is right about forecasted issues ahead of time. 
Even if forecasted issues concern all events that lead to a grid state out of acceptable limits (set by operation policy), use cases of the project focus on managing overloads only: this KPI therefore only focuses on alerts related to line overloads. 
The calculation of KPI relies on simulation of 2 parallel paths (starting from the moment the alert is raised): 
- Simulation of the “do nothing” path, to assess the truth values
- Application of remedial actions to the “do nothing” path, to assess solved cases 
To calculate the KPI, all interventions by an agent or operator are fixed to a specific plan since every alert is related to a specific plan (e.g. remedial actions). 
Note: line contingencies for which alerts can be raised are the lines that can be attacked in the environment (env.alertable_line_ids in grid2Op), so this should be properly configured beforehand. ","This KPI contributes to evaluating Effectiveness of the AI-based assistant, as part of Task 4.1 evaluation objectives, and O2 main project objective. ","The formula to compute the KPI is the confusion matrix (see Calculation Methodology): 
- TP, True positive cases, forecast alerts were raised by the AI assistant, and overloads did occur on the transmission grid) 
- FP, False positive cases, forecast alerts were raised by the AI assistant, but no overload occurred on the transmission grid 
- TN, True negative cases, the AI assistant raised no forecast alert, and no overload occurred on the transmission grid 
- FN, False negative cases, the AI assistant raised no forecast alert, but overloads occurred on the transmission grid 
- Starting from True positive cases, TPS, the True positive cases solved, represent the alert effectively solved by the recommendations.

For agents trained using machine learning methods, this can cause an offset between the type of states encountered in the training data and during deployment, especially for agents trained using reinforcement learning or similar methods where the agent itself decides which actions to execute. As a consequence of this offset, the agent might make poorer decisions if the human operator does not always follow the proposed actions of the agents. 
To measure how sensitive the agent is to such offsets, this KPI proposes to use a “simulated operator” that does not fully follow the course of actions suggested by the agents, and instead overwrites certain action variables set by the agents in a fraction of time steps.

","A simulated operator is defined that deviates from the agent's suggestions in a certain percentage of time steps.

The performance of the primary AI agent (e.g., environment native reward function) is then measured in the precence of these deviations.","Environment reward, or the unit of measurement of a suitably-chosen use-case specific metric.
