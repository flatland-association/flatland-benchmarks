An assumption is that a Human Machine Interaction (HMI) module is available.  ","This KPI addresses the following objectives: 
1. Given an alert, how much time is left until the problem occurs? 
The longer the better since it gives more time to make a decision.   
2. Given an alert, how much time does the AI assistant take to come up with its recommendations to mitigate the issue? 
The shorter the better. 
3. Given the recommendations by the AI assistant, how much time does the human operator take to make a final decision? 
The shorter the better since it indicates that the recommendations are clear and convincing for the human operator. 
In case there is no interaction possible between the AI assistant and the human operator, this overall split is not possible. Then there is only one overall time needed to decide, starting from the alert and ending with the final decision by the human operator.
