81,KPI-DF-054 (Railway),Domain shift out of domain detection accuracy (Railway),Task 4.2,Reliability,O4,Railway,['Digital environment'],fully automated evaluation,Domain shift – out of domain detection accuracy measures the accuracy with which the agent can detect whether it is operating in a domain that is different from the one it was trained on. It is useful for systems that need to switch strategies or request human intervention when a domain shift is detected. A recent paper proposed by Nasvytis et al. (2024) introduce various approaches for detection of OOD in RL. ,"It is crucial for an AI-based assistant to determine whether it can make reliable decisions in a given configuration. AI algorithms tend to be more dependable when they have been trained on similar configurations. Therefore, if the AI assistant can accurately detect out-of-domain configurations, it can seek human feedback to reduce uncertainty, leading to more adapted and reliable decisions in future scenarios. This KPI allows to determine if AI-based system could detect the shift before decision making. 
This KPI contributes to evaluating Reliability of the AI-based assistant when dealing with real-world conditions which may be slightly different from source domain, as part of Task 4.2 evaluation objectives, and O4 main project objective. ","If a detection algorithm or tool is used, the accuracy of OOD detection is given by: 
(TP+TN)/( TP+TN+FP+FN)
This formula provides a measure of how well the agent can detect domain shifts, balancing both the correct identification of OOD and ID scenarios. It is essential for systems that need to adapt their strategies or seek human intervention when a domain shift is detected.
