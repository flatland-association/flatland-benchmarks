### Review Pull Requests

## Technical Guidelines

### Clean Code

Please adhere to the general [Clean Code](https://www.planetgeek.ch/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Clean-Code-V2.4.pdf)
principles. For instance, we write short and concise functions and use appropriate naming to ensure readability.

## Pull Requests

1. Open a pull request on GitHub targeting the `main` branch.
   Make sure to fill out the template.
    * *Principle 1*: A review from a core team member is automatically requested.
      At least one approval is required to merge for non-core team members.
    * *Principle 2*: Formulate your expectations on **risk** (e.g. low/mid/high) and **feedback/discussion** (e.g. high: new concept XYZ, minor: refactoring).

2. Once successfully reviewed, squash-merge the PR.
   This collapses all the commits into one and merges it into the `main` branch.
   Please adjust the subject line and body of the commit to accurately reflect your changes.
