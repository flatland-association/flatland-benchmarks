Taking this into account, the objective is to be able to tune the system autonomy level based on the implicit assessment in real time.  \nFor example, higher traffic or hard situations/decisions will be detected with any interference with the human operator, implicitly providing information to be used by the decision system. \nThis KPI will not focus on the final results when this module is integrated, but in the calculation of personalized cognitive and stress metrics of a single human based on an individual assessment protocol. If we are not able to perform such protocol, then this module will be generic and not personalized, removing this KPIs. In the personalization we aim to achieve a 20-30% improvement on performance of the model based for a single individual data, enabling a high level of personalization. \nThis KPI contributes to evaluating Human-user experience of the AI-based assistant, as part of Task 4.3 evaluation objectives, and O3 main project objective.
