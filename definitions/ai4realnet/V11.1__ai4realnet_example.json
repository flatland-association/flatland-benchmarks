Taking this into account, the objective is to be able to tune the system autonomy level based on the implicit assessment in real time.\nFor example, higher traffic or hard situations/decisions will be detected with any interference with the human operator, implicitly providing information to be used by the decision system.\nThis KPI will not focus on the final results when this module is integrated, but in the calculation of personalized cognitive and stress metrics of a single human based on an individual assessment protocol. If we are not able to perform such protocol, then this module will be generic and not personalized, removing this KPIs. In the personalization we aim to achieve a 20-30% improvement on performance of the model based for a single individual data, enabling a high level of personalization.\nThis KPI contributes to evaluating Human-user experience of the AI-based assistant, as part of Task 4.3 evaluation objectives, and O3 main project objective.

DA can be defined as the capability to deploy a model trained in one or more source domains into a different target domain. We consider that the source and target domains have the same feature space. In this sense, it is important for RL based agents to have a reasonable adaptation time to a new domain which may present a slight shift from the source domain. However, the adaptation time should also consider the performance drop into its computation, as a high performance drop after the adaptation could not be tolerated.\nThis KPI contributes to evaluating Reliability of the AI-based assistant when dealing with real-world conditions which may be slightly different from source domain, as part of Task 4.2 evaluation objectives, and O4 main project objective.

As a consequence of this offset, the agent might make poorer decisions if the human operator does not always follow the proposed actions of the agents.\nTo measure how sensitive the agent is to such offsets, this KPI proposes to use a \u201csimulated operator\u201d that does not fully follow the course of actions suggested by the agents, and instead overwrites certain action variables set by the agents in a fraction of time steps.
